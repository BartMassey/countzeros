# countzeros
Copyright Â© 2015 Bart Massey

This little software suite counts the number of zero and one
bits in a collection of files. It consists of several parts:

* `countzeros.c` is the core fast bit-counter which reads
  standard input.

* `run1.sh` runs `countzeros` on each of its command-line arguments.

* There are three versions of the statistics processor that
  analyzes the per-file statistics for mean and standard
  deviation.

  * `process.py` is in Python 3. This is the default.

  * `process.awk` is in AWK. Unfortunately, for very large
    collections of large files the lack of
    arbitrary-precision integers makes AWK behave badly.

  * `process.5c` is in [Nickle](http://nickle.org). This
    language is probably best because 256-bit default floating
    mantissa, but it is not widely used or known.

* `run.sh` orchestrates the test. Invoke it with one
   argument: the root of the directory tree you want
   to gather statistics on. Currently, it will not leave
   its target filesystem looking for files.
